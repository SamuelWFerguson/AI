# TSP Genetic Algorithm Application
This is an application for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using a genetic algorithm.

**What is the Traveling Salesman Problem?**
A problem in which you are given a list of cities and are told to find the shortest possible path connecting these cities

**What is a genetic algorithm?**
An algorithm which is inspired by the process of natural selection in which all lifeforms breed, mutate, and die.
A genetic algorithm goes through these same cycles and as it does, it improves itself.

**What does the TSP Genetic Algorithm Application do?**
This application aims to find near-optimal results for the TSP in non-polynomial time using a genetic algorithm.
To do this, a 'population' of solutions is put through the 3 basic cycles of life: breeding, mutation, and death.
This population improves itself each cycle until eventually a ceiling is reached where the algorithm is no longer making significant improvments.
At this ceiling, the genetic algorithm has found its near-optimal population.
